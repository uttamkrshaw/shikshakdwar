    ENEN's goal is to embed sustainable climate action into corporate activity. Effectiveness, transparency, and credibility are the keys to work with you to design solutions that are suitable for our clientele. It’s up to you whether you adopt the entire range of measures – from long-term climate action strategy to offsetting of your total emissions – or simply select individual building blocks, such as carbon footprint assessment or consultancy around carbon emission reduction.
